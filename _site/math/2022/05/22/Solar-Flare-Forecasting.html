        <p>I find it silly to resort to machine learning for everything these days. Of course, it’s <em>absolutely</em> a valuable tool and helps mathematicians, computer scientists, alike. Particularly, I value the intersection of deductive reasoning with machine learning filling in the tedious work of crunching numbers and patterns.</p>

<p>Surely, we can say there’s some <em>function</em> that does what we want it to do. Is it a function we should define via machine learning? Likely it is due to the sheer complexity of the natural world.</p>

<p>That being said, my thesis delved into using machine learning to predict solar flares. It would be silly to try and model the photosphere using fundamental physics. It’s just too complex. I decided to visualize an active region as a collection of “things” that interact with one another. If I were to do this again, I would love to formalize that method a bit more.</p>

<p>Alas, <a href="https://github.com/lincketheo/thesis/blob/main/Thesis.pdf">here’s the paper</a>.</p>
