<hr />
<p>Hi, I’m Theo Lincke. I’m a software engineer and a hobby mathematician. I got my Applied Mathematics and Computer Science undergraduate degree from the University of Colorado, Boulder. I’m starting the arduous journey of getting my graduate degree in Electrical Engineering and Network Engineering from George Mason University.</p>

<h1 id="about-the-blog">About the Blog</h1>
<hr />

<p>This blog is intended to cover a broad range of interests and topics. Some posts are long, some are short. Some posts are harder to understand than others (from a purely domain perspective, nobody is knowledgeable in everything, especially what someone else has rabbit holed down recently). To encode this difficulty range, I’ve ranked posts by their relative <em>formality</em> and <em>difficulty</em>. <strong>Only posts of rank 4 will be expected to be formal enough for reference material</strong>. Everything else should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><span class="difficulty_ranking difficulty_0">0</span> These posts are light reads - not intended to be technical or challenging to get through. You could read these like a book.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="difficulty_ranking difficulty_1">1</span> These posts are light reads, but contain technical information. For example, a readable / easy post about math that talks about concepts intuitively.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="difficulty_ranking difficulty_2">2</span> These posts are medium reads. They likely contain mostly technical content expressed in an easy/readable way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="difficulty_ranking difficulty_3">3</span> These posts start getting technical. Depending on the topic, there might be some prerequisite knowledge. For example, if it’s a post about bootloaders, you might need some assembly background first.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="difficulty_ranking difficulty_4">4</span> These posts are technical and I will try my best to be <em>as formal as possible</em>. For math posts, I think an undergraduate degree in mathematics or a course taken in some of the prerequiste concepts is probably necessary.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I will constantly be adjusting this scale as I, myself, learn more and can express myself more technically / express more challenging problems.</p>

<p>I’m using MathJax. I’ll likely switch to Katex in the future, but sometimes equations don’t load fast enough in your browser. Nothing that a refresh usually won’t fix.</p>
