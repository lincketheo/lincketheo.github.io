Hi, I’m Theo Lincke. I’m a software engineer and Mathematician with way too many interests to count. I graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of Colorado, Boulder, with a dual major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I currently work for Garmin International as a software engineer.

Please keep in mind that all opinions expressed on this website and social media are my personal views; they are not reflective of, nor endorsed by, my employer.

Although my favorite subject was Analysis (both real and complex), I decided at this point in my life I would much instead build things than go into research. I continue to try my best to keep up to date on mathematics and theoretical computer science research; however, my current goals are to build myself as an engineer first and a theorist second.
