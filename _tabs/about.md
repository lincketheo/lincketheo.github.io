I graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of Colorado, Boulder with a degree in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. Although my favorite subject was Analysis (both real and complex), I decided at this point in my life, I would much rather build things than go into research. I continue to try my best to keep up to date on mathematics and theoretical computer science research, however, my current goals are to build myself as an engineer, first, and a theorist second.
