## Introduction

A company is starting a new project, and they're trying to figure out which technologies to use. 

How does your average software engineer work on a day to day basis? How can we use these observations to speed up development by designing more
friendly / natural language features (specifically for software engineering domains like UI, Machine Learning etc).

1. Which language should we chose? 
2. Which database should we use? 

## Language

Take a moment to ignore enterprise standards when it comes to software. Ignore testing, clean code, code reviews etc and think
about the average software engineering working on 

### A Metric for Language Efficiency

Consider **the number of times a program is run while an average software engineer is working/debugging issues**. 

- In donkey typed / dynamic typed languages like javascript and python, this number is going to be high because of the following reasons:
- In statically typed languages like Java / Kotlin, this number is likely going to be much lower

- **Statically Typed langauges
