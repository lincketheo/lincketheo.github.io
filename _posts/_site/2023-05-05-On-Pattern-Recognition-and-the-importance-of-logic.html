<p><em>(Eagle, Turtle and Robot stop by Owl’s house for a cup of tea and biscuits).</em></p>

<p>Owl: Whoo, well who-ello my friends, I’m delighted to have you stop by just in time for my extra delicious Banana flavored tea with spam, eggs and fried marmot!</p>

<p>Turtle: And you, owl. By the way, what a lovely place you have. I absolutely adore your silverware, the vibrant number 2 on your dish plate is exquisite indeed.</p>

<p>Eagle: Eh, I’ve seen better; I’d bet you my beak that those were hand-me-downs from a more… er… how do I say this… colorful creature.</p>

<p>Robot: (<em>in a joyful tone because he’s never actually met an owl face to face</em>): BEEP WHIRRR BOOP</p>

<p>Owl: Ah, I’m glad to hear it, robot, and to you, eagle, whoo-well, you can’t please everyone. (<em>grabs a cup of fried marmot and hands it to each of her three guests</em>). So you noticed the pattern on the silverware, have you turtle?</p>

<p>Turtle: Pattern? What pattern? All I see is a number 2, embroidered in gold, bumpy text on the surface of the plate.</p>

<p>Eagle: Ah, turtle, aren’t you a foolish thing. Owl is talking about the pattern of numbers on the plates. Obviously, she means the plates are ordered in an interesting way. Heck, I bet you my beak that the plate underneath that one contains a number 2 on it as well! That would be quite the magnificent pattern indeed!</p>

<p>Turtle: Whatever do you mean. How on earth did you come up with that conclusion without having seen all of the plates in the entire stack! I didn’t even have a clue Owl was talking about the plates, or the numbers on the plates, or anything related to a pattern at all!</p>

<p>Owl: Whooo- relax, my friends. I apologize for being so vague. I didn’t mean to cause such a comotion.</p>

<p>Robot: (<em>In a confused voice because he is  quite lost</em>) BEEP WHIRRR BOOP</p>

<p>Owl: Ah, Robot, you’re correct, they are acting quite rash, aren’t they. Well, I must clarify. My dishes, <em>are</em> in fact ordered in an interesting way. Eagle, you sly thing, you understood my question immediately.</p>

<p>Eagle: Why of course I did, of all the animals I’ve ever laid my talons on, I do believe I am the most intelligent.</p>

<p>Owl: Right you are, a sharp one at that. But please, turtle, now that you understand my question, when I lift this plate with a number 2 on it, what do you expect to see underneath it?</p>

<p>Turtle: Well, owl, I have no idea! You haven’t told me anything other than the fact that there <em>is</em> a pattern at all! It could be a 3, a 4, oh wait! what about 5! that’s surely what the next number is!</p>

<p>Eagle: Turtle, you stupid green dud. I don’t have time for silly games like these, it’s clearly another 2. What deranged creature would buy plates that look differently from one another!</p>

<p>Owl: Relax, eagle. He’s only trying his best. So Turtle believes the next number to be 5, eagle believes the next number to be 2, and what of you robot? What do you think the next number will be?</p>

<p>Robot: (<em>in a startled tone because he was distracted by two squirrels running up a tree in the distance</em>) BEEP WHIRRR BOOP</p>

<p>Owl: Brilliant guess! 3,156,789.123 is a wonderful idea indeed! I truly wonder if you are correct!</p>

<p>Eagle: (<em>sighs and puts his head in his feathers</em>) My friends, you truly must not understand the task well enough. Well, owl, could you please show us so I can be on my merry way?</p>

<p>Owl: Of course! Whooo (<em>strolls to her dish set, and removes the top plate. Underneath the plate is another plate with a sparkling ruby number 4 on it</em>).</p>

<p>Turtle: AH Ha! Of course, how did I not think of this! It’s a number 4.</p>

<p>Eagle: (<em>Shivers slightly, then regains his composure</em>). Of course it was 4,  that’s clearly what my original guess was. Owl, you silly thing, please let us go. I know what you’re going to ask. You’ll ask “and whoo, what number does the next plate have on it?” and we’ll all respond with our guessess and…</p>

<p>Robot: (<em>out of the blue</em>) BEEP WHIRRR BOOP</p>

<p>Owl: Of course, robot, I will shut him up as soon as I can. I must continue with this story, or else my audience will lose interest from such a babbling baboon of a bird.</p>

<p>Eagle: Ah, yes, what a baboon of a turtle, you’re soo eloquent in your words.</p>

<p>Turtle: Are you this vain, Eagle? That you don’t even hear others when they criticize your thoughts?</p>

<p>Eagle: <em>distracted by the two squirrels, now a little closer</em>.</p>

<p>Robot: (<em>In the same tone you have when you have to answer a question while eating your breakfast in a tired state</em>) BEEP WHIRRR BOOP</p>

<p>Owl: Very well, let me see… Ah, yes, I remember, I was going to ask you three what number is on the next plate! What about you robot, what do you think the next number is?</p>

<p>Robot: (<em>satisfactorily</em>) BEEP WHIRRR BOOP</p>

<p>Owl: That’s a good guess indeed! You are such a smart machine, seeing that your original guess was too high, so you picked one number less at 3,156,788.123! What a brilliant strategy indeed! And you, turtle? What do you guess.</p>

<p>Turtle: Well, my dear owl, I consider myself slow, and I don’t know if I can easily guess what the number is at all! I see that the previous plate was 2, and the current plate was 4. What I do know is that the next number could be anything at all! There are, in fact an infinite number of choices.</p>

<p>Owl: Well, turtle, I understand your hesitancy, but surely you have at least a sliver of an idea. I wouldn’t even be mad if your guess was incorrect. Please… tell me the first number that pops up in your head.</p>

<p>Turtle: Well, ok, I suppose the next number <em>must</em> be an 8. I really don’t know why, but it’s just the first number I thought about.</p>

<p>Eagle: Don’t be silly turtle, your guess is a silly one and your silly shell looks silly on you. The next plate <em>must</em> have a number 6 on it. It’s the only way. The plates are, indeed all numbered evenly.</p>

<p>Owl: Understood, let me take off the next plate (<em>strolls back to the dishes and pulls the top plate off only to reveal a number 8</em>).</p>

<p>Eagle: (<em>jumps up excitedly and bounces around the room a little</em>) AH HA!! OH HO!! Here I GO! A master of numbers! a master of all of you fools. I knew the number was…</p>

<p>Owl: Eagle… please calm yourself. What are your thoughts turtle?</p>

<p>Turtle: Well, I suppose it makes sense, but again, I still have no reason to think that there is a number on the next plate at all. The only thing you have told me is that you pull off creates some sort of pattern. What the pattern is, if it is a number at all, or a random squiggle is unclear to me. I just don’t have enough information to make a valid judgment.</p>

<p>Owl: Understandable… and you, robot, what do you think?</p>

<p>Robot: (<em>In a curious tone, now he’s interested</em>) BEEP WHIRRR BOOP</p>

<p>Owl: Ah, you sneaky pile of wires. You noticed that your first guess was too high, so you subtracted 1. Then, you noticed that your <strong>SECOND</strong> guess was too high as well! So you said to yourself, “hmm… if both my first and my second guess were so high, maybe I ought to try harder to reduce the value of my third guess” so you decided that instead of subtracting 1 from your guess, you will subtract 2! A brilliant play by a brialliant hunk of metal.</p>

<p>Robot: (<em>blushing</em>) BEEP WHIRRR BOOP</p>

<p>Eagle: And of my guess, Owl? What do you think of me? I made the right answer. Do I get anything in return?</p>

<p>Owl: Well, errr… not really. I do respect your genius, my dear friend. Maybe I will pour you some extra tea (<em>pours eagle an extra 1/4 a cup of tea</em>). Now, turtle, tell me what your next guess is?</p>

<p>Turtle: Well, hmmm. Because I was formally educated by the tortise cult, when I was learning numbers, I learned them using multiplication, first, then addition. So my first guess was that the next plate would be a number 5, then I noticed that it was indeed a number 4! So I saw that 2*2 is equal to 4! So I guessed the number 8 because I learned about my multiplication table before I learned about addition. Naturally, I suppose, my next guess would be the number 8!</p>

<p>Eagle: Um… why must you always have such an uneducated opinion, turtle. The answer is clearly 6. Who in their right mind learns about multiplication before addition?</p>

<p>Owl: Well, let’s see. Robot’s guess is 3,156,786.123 (that is, his second guess minus 2), turtle’s guess is 8 (the second number multiplied by 2), and eagle’s guess is 6 for some reason.</p>

<p>Eagle: That’s right, owl. You’ll look so pitiful when I’m right.</p>

<p>Owl: Well, Whoooo-let’s figure this out once and for all! (<em>Lifts the top plate from the stack to reveal a number 6</em>). Bee gads, eagle! I hate to admit, but you were right! The number is, in fact 6!</p>

<p>Eagle: But of course, at this point, you are wasting my time.</p>

<p>Turtle: Doh! That would have been my second guess! In my cult of tortises, I first learned multiplication, then, I learned about <a href="https://oeis.org/A002182">highly composite numbers</a>! Where the first 5 terms of the sequence are 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12! Naturally, the next plate <em>must</em> be 12!</p>

<p>Robot: (<em>annoyed and frustrated with himself</em>) BEEP WHIRRR BOOP</p>

<p>Owl: Well of course, robot. Turtle is just trying his best. It isn’t his fault that he learned about powers of two, then about highly composite numbers before he learned to add!</p>

<p>Eagle: Ok, owl, here’s the deal, you’ve wasted enough of my time. If the next plate on the stack isn’t an 8, then I’ll bet my beak that I’ll leave out these doors as quickly as a raven leaves for lunch.</p>

<p>Owl: Ok, ok, ok. Robot, please tell me what you think the next number on the stack is.</p>

<p>Robot: (<em>still annoyed because he also stubbed his wire a few seconds ago while in frustration that his last answer was so wrong</em>) BEEP WHIRRR BOOP</p>

<p>Owl: A brilliant answer indeed! I am astounded by your creativity and might. You noticed that your first three answers were incorrect, however, you also noticed that they were getting closer and closer! So you decided that the second guess would subtract 1 from your first guess, and your third guess would subtract 2 from your second guess, then you realized you were getting closer, so you subtracted 0.5 from your third guess to get your fourth guess of  the next answer of 3,156,785.623. I can’t even imagine the complex circuitry going on in your metal head of yours.</p>

<p>Robot: (<em>with a straight face</em>) BEEP WHIRRR BOOP</p>

<p>Owl: And you, turtle, used your specialized intuition to guess that the sequence was, first: a random set of numbers, but when that wasn’t the case, you new that the simplest form of arithmetic was multiplication, so you guessed that the series of numbers were all powers of 2. Then, when you realized that was incorrect, you guessed the second most common sequence (to you) to be highly composite numbers. Interesting thought process indeed.</p>

<p>Turtle: Well, of course. It isn’t my fault that I think highly composite numbers are more fascinating than regular numbers.</p>

<p>Owl: And you, eagle, the sharp mighty quick whitted bird of the skies. You thought that because the first number was 2, the only natural way for the next plate to show up would be for it to also be a number 2. When you noticed that the next plate was number 4, you slyly changed your answered and figured that the sequence was all the even numbers, only to guess the number 6 next. And by the tip of one wing to the other wing, I congradualte you on your victorious guess. Your next guess is 8 is it not?</p>

<p>Eagle: Why must I repeat myself at all, owl, the next number <em>must</em> be number 8. What else could it be?</p>

<p>Owl: Well, alright, let me see here. Let’s see what the next number is, shall we? (<em>proceeds to pull off the top plate to reveal… nothing! There was no number on the next plate</em>).</p>
